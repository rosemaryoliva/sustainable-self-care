		<h1>Hair Care</h1>
	<p>
		Say goodbye to the plastic shampoo and conditioner bottles that end up staying in the shower long after they are finished. This shampoo and conditioner duo has ZERO packaging and hold more product than your average bottle of liquid product.

	<h2>Tea Tree Facial Bar Soap</h2>
	<p>
		*No package 
		*No perfumes; sulfates; alcohols 
		*Organic; Fair Trade 

		A balanced and gentle facial soap, this bar detoxifies skin with absorbent activated charcoal. Cocoa butter promotes a youthful complexion, while ground oats soothe and mildly exfoliate. Fresh and herbaceous tea tree and eucalyptus oils act as a natural astringent to combat skin blemishes. Also great for the whole body!

	<h2>The Hydration Conditioner Bar</h2>
	<p>
		 *100% essential oil
		*Vegan + cruelty-free 
		*Lasts approximately 50-75 washes 
		*Color-safe, can be used with extensions

		Sometimes you need a little hydration, sometimes you need a lot! With colloidal oatmeal and amla oil, the Hydrator works to treat scalp ailments, including dryness, eczema, psoriasis, and rashes; and we all know that a healthy scalp makes for healthy hair. Chock full of vitamin B and the natural polysaccharide beta glucan, which acts as an emollient, the colloidal oatmeal delivers shine, moisture and damage repair, making your hair less brittle and more elastic with each use. Equivalent to 2-3 16 oz bottles of liquid product.
